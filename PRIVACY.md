# Privacy Policy

**Last Updated**: February 13, 2026

## Overview

GLBI Canada is committed to protecting your privacy. This app was designed with privacy as a core principle.

## Data Collection

**We do not collect any personal data.**

Specifically:
- No personal information is collected
- No usage analytics are gathered
- No crash reports are sent
- No device identifiers are accessed
- No location data is used
- No contact information is accessed

## Data Storage

All data you enter in the app:
- Remains on your device only
- Is not synchronized to any server
- Is not backed up to any cloud service
- Is only stored temporarily in app memory

## Data Sharing

The app does **not** automatically share any data. Data is only shared when you explicitly choose to:

1. **Export PDF**: When you export a brief as PDF, it is saved to your device's local storage
2. **Share Intent**: When you tap "Share", the Android system share dialog appears, and you control where the PDF is sent
3. **External Links**: When you tap links to parliamentary websites, your browser opens those pages

## Third-Party Services

This app does **not** use:
- Analytics services (e.g., Google Analytics, Firebase Analytics)
- Advertising networks
- Social media integrations
- Push notification services
- Any third-party data collection services

## Network Access

The app only accesses the network when:
- You explicitly tap a link to view parliamentary bills or submission guidance
- These links open in your device's default web browser
- The app itself does not make any background network requests

## Permissions

The app requests minimal permissions:

### Storage Permission (Android 9 and below)
- **Purpose**: To save PDF files of your briefs
- **Scope**: Only used when you explicitly choose to export a PDF
- **Alternative**: On Android 10+, scoped storage is used (no permission required)

## Children's Privacy

This app does not knowingly collect any data from anyone, including children under 13.

## Changes to Privacy Policy

If the privacy policy changes (for example, if features are added that require data handling), the app version will be updated and changes will be clearly communicated.

## Your Rights

Since we don't collect any data:
- There is no data to access
- There is no data to delete
- There is no data to correct
- There is no data to export (beyond your own local files)

## Contact

If you have questions about this privacy policy:
- Open an issue on GitHub: https://github.com/jvm2020/glbi
- The app is maintained by Joseph Vander Meer

## Legal Basis

We don't process personal data, so GDPR/PIPEDA requirements for lawful basis don't apply. However, we've designed this app to exceed privacy standards as a matter of principle.

## Open Source

This app is open source. You can review the code to verify these privacy claims:

## Summary

**Bottom line**: Your data is yours. We don't see it, we don't collect it, we don't want it. The app works entirely on your device.
